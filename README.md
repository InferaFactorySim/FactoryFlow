# FactoryFlow
This is a PoC done to validate the FactoryFlow application



FactoryFlow is the expert in the loop AMG flow that takes natural language descriptions of system
structure and employs LLM-based agentic workflows to generate process-based, readable DES
models. The resulting model is a network of parameterized component instances from FactorySimPy. FactorySimPy is a core component of the AMG flow. It is a lightweight, open-source Python library
that provides configurable simulation models for components in manufacturing systems. Systems
are described as interconnected components with associated parameters, and the interconnection
follows well-defined rules to enable automated validation.

FactoryFlow is an LLM based-tool that uses Gemini-2.5-pro.
